    <hr>
    <p>Early on, Ganesh Chaturthi was celebrated in a few families. Later on, it spread all over and thus began the installation of idols and immersion in the water. This marked the beginning of making Ganesh Chaturthi a larger than life festival. In other words, the idol immersion denotes freedom from evil and sufferings.People take bath in the early morning on the day of Ganesha Chaturthi, wear clean clothes and worship God. They offer many things and pray to God by chanting mantras, aarti song, and devotional songs and perform other rituals of Hindu religion. Earlier, this festival was celebrated only in some families.</p>
